<h2 class="title-heading">Getting Started with TACS.NET</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Welcome to the TACS.NET Manager application.&nbsp; TACS.NET is 
a client/server framework designed to provide access control services for web 
and desktop applications built on Microsoft&#39;s .NET Framework.&nbsp; With this 
application you may manage TACS.NET applications, accounts, project databases, 
security roles, and user profiles.&nbsp; Please refer to the TACS.NET Software 
Development Kit for additional documentation on building applications using this 
framework.</p>
<h3 class="title-heading">TACS.NET Objects</h3>
<p class="paragraph">In order to understand TACS.NET&#39;s architecture, it is helpful 
to understand the various objects available and their functionality.&nbsp; See 
the following definitions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="paragraph"><strong>Application</strong> -- An application that uses 
	this framework must be registered in the TACS.NET database.&nbsp; Registered 
	applications are shown in the Application Explorer window.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="paragraph"><strong>Account</strong> -- Project databases and user 
	profiles are grouped under accounts.&nbsp; An account represents a client 
	with one or more project databases and user profiles.&nbsp; An account can 
	be opened from the File...Open menu option or by pressing CTRL+O.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="paragraph"><strong>Project</strong> -- Represents a project database.&nbsp; 
	The project record contains the database access credentials for a given 
	application.&nbsp; Credentials are generated when a user successfully 
	authenticates with the TACS.NET Server, thus eliminating the need to store 
	credentials on the user&#39;s local computer.&nbsp; Projects registered under an 
	account are displayed in the Project Explorer window after you open an 
	account.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="paragraph"><strong>Roles</strong> -- Security roles are created on a 
	per project basis.&nbsp; Applications use role objects to decide what 
	features a user has access to.&nbsp; Roles are edited by opening the 
	associated project from the Project Explorer.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="paragraph"><strong>Users</strong> -- User objects define which users 
	are allowed to login and use specified projects with certain applications.&nbsp; 
	Users registered under an account are displayed in the User Explorer window 
	after you open an account.&nbsp; You may also assign users to projects by 
	editing a specific user profile.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
